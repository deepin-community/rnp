# rnp now uses submodules upstream, but they might move to libsexpp as
# a separate linked library.
# if they continue with the submodules, we probably need to fetch the
# upstream "release", not just the tag.
# we might need to use the kind of mangling suggested by David Steele in
# https://bugs.debian.org/1019696#30
